公式反用
1，举一反三
he went upstairs
he died upstairs
he ran upstairs
he sleeps upstairs
he is drank upstairs
i didn't see him upstairs
he is waiting upstairs
he is upstairs

he went abroad
he is going to drive abroad
he flew abroad
he is learning abroad
he saw him abroad
he is lost abroad
he was killed abroad
he is working abroad
he is abroad

及物动词、不及物动词(名词前加介词)
he went to beijing 
	he went abroad  go不及物，abroad是副词,只要结构对中文意思对，句子就是对的
	he flew abroad
	he saw him abroad
	he is lost abroad
	he is working abroad
he lives in beijing
i am thinking about this thing
he is looking at you
he is listening to the music
i am talking to you about him
he got home late

2, 词性判断
he lives X X   			live 可及物可不及物，住的意思不及物，只能是副词或介词短语
	he lives near here	介词短语(near介词,here名词)。如果是介词短语，两个词一个都不能去掉，意思是否改变来判断是否能去掉
	he lives here		here副词
	he came here late	两个副词。去掉每一个都成立
i don't know about X	句子完整， about X为介词短语，X为名词
he is angry X X			句子完整，只能是副词或介词短语，副词可能是两个副词
he X on the street		结构不完成，X只能是个动词，on the street 做状语
i left beijing X him 	结构完整，只能是个副词
he is looking X			结构完整，副词做状语
