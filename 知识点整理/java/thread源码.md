https://blog.csdn.net/a_bcd_123/article/details/70037502            从源码角度分析java 的 sleep()和wait()究竟有什么区别？

## Thread

### State

        /**
         * Thread state for a thread which has not yet started.
         */
        NEW,
    
        /**

         * state is executing in the Java virtual machine but it may
         * be waiting for other resources from the operating system
         * such as processor.
         */
        RUNNABLE,
    
        /**
         * Thread state for a thread blocked waiting for a monitor lock.
         * A thread in the blocked state is waiting for a monitor lock
         * to enter a synchronized block/method or
         * reenter a synchronized block/method after calling

         */
        BLOCKED,
    
        /**

         */
        TIMED_WAITING,

        TERMINATED;



```  private static native void registerNatives();
    
public class Thread implements Runnable {
    static {
        registerNatives();
    }
}
```

### Thread.c

对应的c代码在 `\jdk\src\share\native\java\lang\Thread.c`

```static JNINativeMethod methods[] = {
static JNINativeMethod methods[] = {
    {"start0",           "()V",        (void *)&JVM_StartThread},
    {"stop0",            "(" OBJ ")V", (void *)&JVM_StopThread},
    {"isAlive",          "()Z",        (void *)&JVM_IsThreadAlive},
    {"suspend0",         "()V",        (void *)&JVM_SuspendThread},
    {"resume0",          "()V",        (void *)&JVM_ResumeThread},
    {"setPriority0",     "(I)V",       (void *)&JVM_SetThreadPriority},
    {"yield",            "()V",        (void *)&JVM_Yield},
    {"sleep",            "(J)V",       (void *)&JVM_Sleep},
    {"currentThread",    "()" THD,     (void *)&JVM_CurrentThread},
    {"countStackFrames", "()I",        (void *)&JVM_CountStackFrames},
    {"interrupt0",       "()V",        (void *)&JVM_Interrupt},
    {"isInterrupted",    "(Z)Z",       (void *)&JVM_IsInterrupted},
    {"holdsLock",        "(" OBJ ")Z", (void *)&JVM_HoldsLock},
    {"getThreads",        "()[" THD,   (void *)&JVM_GetAllThreads},
    {"dumpThreads",      "([" THD ")[[" STE, (void *)&JVM_DumpThreads},
    {"setNativeName",    "(" STR ")V", (void *)&JVM_SetNativeThreadName},
};

#undef THD
#undef OBJ
#undef STE
#undef STR

JNIEXPORT void JNICALL
Java_java_lang_Thread_registerNatives(JNIEnv *env, jclass cls)
{
    (*env)->RegisterNatives(env, cls, methods, ARRAY_LENGTH(methods));
}
```

对于Thread.start方法调用了start0对应的是JVM_StartThread

``` public synchronized void start() {
        /**
         * This method is not invoked for the main method thread or "system"
         * group threads created/set up by the VM. Any new functionality added
         * to this method in the future may have to also be added to the VM.
         *
         * A zero status value corresponds to state "NEW".
         */
        if (threadStatus != 0)
            throw new IllegalThreadStateException();

        /* Notify the group that this thread is about to be started
         * so that it can be added to the group's list of threads
         * and the group's unstarted count can be decremented. */
        group.add(this);

        boolean started = false;
        try {
            start0();
            started = true;
        } finally {
            try {
                if (!started) {
                    group.threadStartFailed(this);
                }
            } catch (Throwable ignore) {
                /* do nothing. If start0 threw a Throwable then
                  it will be passed up the call stack */
            }
        }
    }
```

### jvm.cpp # JVM_StartThread()

`JVM_StartThread`方法位于`src/hotspot/share/prims/jvm.cpp`

```c
JVM_ENTRY(void, JVM_StartThread(JNIEnv* env, jobject jthread))
  JVMWrapper("JVM_StartThread");
  JavaThread *native_thread = NULL;

  // We cannot hold the Threads_lock when we throw an exception,
  // due to rank ordering issues. Example:  we might need to grab the
  // Heap_lock while we construct the exception.
  bool throw_illegal_thread_state = false;

  // We must release the Threads_lock before we can post a jvmti event
  // in Thread::start.
  {
    // Ensure that the C++ Thread and OSThread structures aren't freed before
    // we operate.
    MutexLocker mu(Threads_lock);

    // Since JDK 5 the java.lang.Thread threadStatus is used to prevent
    // re-starting an already started thread, so we should usually find
    // that the JavaThread is null. However for a JNI attached thread
    // there is a small window between the Thread object being created
    // (with its JavaThread set) and the update to its threadStatus, so we
    // have to check for this
    if (java_lang_Thread::thread(JNIHandles::resolve_non_null(jthread)) != NULL) {
      throw_illegal_thread_state = true;
    } else {
      // We could also check the stillborn flag to see if this thread was already stopped, but
      // for historical reasons we let the thread detect that itself when it starts running

      jlong size =
             java_lang_Thread::stackSize(JNIHandles::resolve_non_null(jthread));
      // Allocate the C++ Thread structure and create the native thread.  The
      // stack size retrieved from java is signed, but the constructor takes
      // size_t (an unsigned type), so avoid passing negative values which would
      // result in really large stacks.
      size_t sz = size > 0 ? (size_t) size : 0;
      // 创建c++级别的线程，&thread_entry是java种run的入口方法
      native_thread = new JavaThread(&thread_entry, sz);

      // At this point it may be possible that no osthread was created for the
      // JavaThread due to lack of memory. Check for this situation and throw
      // an exception if necessary. Eventually we may want to change this so
      // that we only grab the lock if the thread was created successfully -
      // then we can also do this check and throw the exception in the
      // JavaThread constructor.
      // 检查该本地线程中是否包含OSThread，因为可能出现由于内存不足导致OSThread未创建成功的情况
      if (native_thread->osthread() != NULL) {
        // Note: the current thread is not being used within "prepare".
        // java线程和c++线程关联
        native_thread->prepare(jthread);
      }
    }
  }

  if (throw_illegal_thread_state) {
    THROW(vmSymbols::java_lang_IllegalThreadStateException());
  }

  assert(native_thread != NULL, "Starting null thread?");

  if (native_thread->osthread() == NULL) {
    // No one should hold a reference to the 'native_thread'.
    delete native_thread;
    if (JvmtiExport::should_post_resource_exhausted()) {
      JvmtiExport::post_resource_exhausted(
        JVMTI_RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED_OOM_ERROR | JVMTI_RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED_THREADS,
        "unable to create new native thread");
    }
    THROW_MSG(vmSymbols::java_lang_OutOfMemoryError(),
              "unable to create new native thread");
  }

  // 启动线程
  Thread::start(native_thread);

JVM_END

```

`JVM_ENTRY`和`JVM_END`是定义的宏，

中间过程看上面的连接 https://hunterzhao.io/post/2018/06/11/hotspot-explore-inside-java-thread-run/



### yield

```c

JVM_ENTRY(void, JVM_Yield(JNIEnv *env, jclass threadClass))
  JVMWrapper("JVM_Yield");
  if (os::dont_yield()) return;
#ifndef USDT2
  HS_DTRACE_PROBE0(hotspot, thread__yield);
#else /* USDT2 */
  HOTSPOT_THREAD_YIELD();
#endif /* USDT2 */
  // When ConvertYieldToSleep is off (default), this matches the classic VM use of yield.
  // Critical for similar threading behaviour
  if (ConvertYieldToSleep) {
    os::sleep(thread, MinSleepInterval, false);
  } else {
    os::yield();
  }
JVM_END
```

### os_linux.cpp # os::yield()

`src/hotspot/os/linux/vm/os_linux.cpp`

``` c
void os::yield() {
  sched_yield();
}
```

sched_yield是linux kernel提供的API

```
DESCRIPTION
       sched_yield()  causes  the  calling  thread to relinquish the CPU.  The  thread is moved to the end of the queue for its static priority  and  a  new thread gets to run.
RETURN VALUE
       On  success,  sched_yield()  returns  0.  On error, -1 is returned, and errno is set appropriately.
ERRORS
       In the Linux implementation, sched_yield() always succeeds.
翻译一下，sched_yield()会让出当前线程的CPU占有权，然后把线程放到静态优先队列的尾端，然后一个新的线程会占用CPU。 
sched_yield()这个函数可以使用另一个级别等于或高于当前线程的线程先运行。如果没有符合条件的线程，那么这个函数将会立刻返回然后继续执行当前线程的程序。

```
